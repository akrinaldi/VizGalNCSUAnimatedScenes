# VizGalNCSUAnimatedScenes

The following HTML template allows for automatic scene transitions between multiple CSS and JS animated scenes within an array.
The purpose of this template is to allow users to create highly animated scenes that can loop on the NCSU Library gallery spaces screens without interfering with each other.
To view this tempate in action, refer to the EPIAI exhibit code included in the test project folder.

Simply clone this repo to your machine, add your scenes, add your custom CSS, make sure all of your scenes are loaded in the JS file, and then run your index.html.
